Demo to dynamic load po lang files in your msegui application.
It does not use the mseconst_xx.pas of each language and so does not bloat up your application.

User may add new po files without the need to recompile the application.

Here how to do:

Last commit of msegui source is needed.

There are 2 files to adapt: "mseconst_dynpo.pas" for the default data and "msestockobjects_dynpo.pas" for the enums.
Those files are in /mseide-msegui/lib/common/lang_dynpo/, just copy all the files of that directory into the root source directory of your application.

In the demo those files are already pasted.

This are the arrays needed by msegui himself:
   lang_stockcaption, lang_modalresult, lang_modalresultnoshortcut : array of msestring;
   
 There is a lang_mainform array in "mseconsts_dynpo.pas"  that can be used by the application,  you may adapt it as you want.
His enum is  in "msestockobjects_dynpo.pas".

All the translated po files are in directory /demo/lang.

The arrays must be filled at init of your application.
It is done with the procedure  setlangdemo(TheLang) from po2arrays unit, if TheLang = '' then the default consts are used.

For compilation add this parameter: -dmse_dynpo.
